EventBookingPlatform
Overview

This project demonstrates how I build cloud-based, event-driven solutions using ASP.NET Core, React, and several Azure services.
The platform allows users to browse and book events, while the backend processes bookings asynchronously and sends confirmation emails automatically through an Azure Function.
My main goal with this project was to design a scalable, secure, and maintainable application that reflects real-world cloud architecture.
